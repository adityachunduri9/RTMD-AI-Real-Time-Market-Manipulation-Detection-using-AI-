Despite SEBI’s robust regulatory framework, many market manipulation tactics—such as pump and dump schemes, circular trading, spoofing, and quote stuffing—still occur subtly and cause substantial damage before they're detected. These manipulations can mislead retail investors, distort price discovery, and erode market trust.
